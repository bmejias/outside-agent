The Outside Agent
======================================================================

This is a project for the Alfresco Global Virtual Hackathon 2015.

The goal is to build a tool that can inspect, monitor, and perform some
administration tasks on multiple Alfresco instances.

The rough starting point is based on shell scripts wrapped up with Makefile
(according to some other fellows, this is old school). So, no fancy interfaces,
just the console.

**Dependencies**

bash
curl
jshon
make
xmllint (libxml2-utils)
